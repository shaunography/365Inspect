    "FindingName": "Administrative Users with No Multi-Factor Authentication Enforced",

Multi-factor authentication is an additional obstacle to adversaries who obtain user credentials through phishing or other means.",
    "Remediation": "There are multiple different ways to roll out MFA and several considerations to take into account before rolling out MFA to the organization. Multi-factor authentication rollout can require significant effort. Follow the detailed O365 MFA guide described below.",
