	"Remediation": "First, look at the \"Affected Objects\" section of the report for this finding; it should indicate which global sharing permission level the organization has currently enabled in SharePoint. If this is too permissive for the organization's use cases, consider taking action. There are multiple ways to change this setting. Navigate to Settings &rarr; Services &rarr; Sites in the O365 Admin portal, or the Sharing page of the SharePoint Administration Center. Doing either should present a list of global sharing capabilities, where \"Share with Anyone\" is the default; change this to a more restrictive setting. Before taking this action, it is advised to engage with other stakeholders in the organization to determine if SharePoint external sharing is used for an organizational function. An appropriate workaround or alternative course of action may need to be determined. Additionally, sharing settings besides the global-level settings are available; consider reading the \"Limit sharing in Microsoft 365\" guide below if additional granularity in sharing settings is required.",
